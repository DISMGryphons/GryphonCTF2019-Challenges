Please help me find the hidden message.

Creator - Pinata

## Hints(Optional)
  1.Might want to ensure the image is all of the same colour
  
## Solution
Creator Method:
Use a code to break the image into RGBA(optional). Notice that its not only (255,255,255,255) change non-255's to any other color that 
makes the words visible(reference in solution\\solve.py

Other Method:
Google and just change all the white areas to black so that the word become visible.
