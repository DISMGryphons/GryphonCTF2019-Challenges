Option 1:
we would provide a hint to the key
user has to spam the key into the program and retrieve out the 4 parts of the hashed flag
the programs spits on a string of ascii dec
so end user has to manually use a ascii table to convert the character one at a time
once all 4 of the ascii strings has been converted to the hash format
user now has to placed the MD5 hash in the correct sequence and go to a online md5 hash decrypt “compare hash”
e.g. https://www.md5online.org/md5-decrypt.html
Flag would be retrieved.

Option 2:
User use jad to decompile the java class file
when the user views the jad file the code would be shown
user would be able to see the hashed ascii
he would still be required to manually match the letters to a ascii table and put the hash into a md5 hash decryptor to retrieve it.
