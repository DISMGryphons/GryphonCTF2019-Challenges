## Hint (Optional)
1. The person that brought us this obstacle will receive A FINE
2. Can machines even be used for encryption? :thinking:

## Solution 
1. Decode the link with Wakandan table
2. First paragraph indicated the existence of slopes and intercepts, which are fields needed for the affine cipher.
3. Decode the given passphrase with the value provided, which are '5' and '8' for slope and intercept respectively.
4. Third paragraph suggests the use of rings as well as position by the cipher, which are used by enigma machines. Tags refer to the rotor number, and spots would be the position.
5. With the resultant decoded text from the previous step, decode it again with the values provided in the text. 
6. Since foreign characters are ignored by default, select `include` such that the curly brackets will be included in the decoded text too.
