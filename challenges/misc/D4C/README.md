### Hints (Optional)
1. Dude, just follow the script! </br>

## Solution
1. Create a Script that will extract the .tar file until it does not need to be extracted
2. There will be 'hint.txt' which will tell users to look out for the numeral 54
3. Change the extension of 'search.PPTX' to 'search.ZIP'
4. In search.ZIP path to /ppt/media and open image54.png </br>
