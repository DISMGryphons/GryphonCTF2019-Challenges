DUDE. I JUST GOT HIT WITH A BRILLIANT IDEA. So rerember our last discussion about world domination and how the plan needed to be hush hush? Well my good friend, we have a solution.

I was just about to hit the hay, diving face first into my pillow, then it hit me. Pillow. A Python library for image processing. You've guess it my friend. I'm talking about our new method of communication. After all, a picture says a thousand words.

Anyways I'm just testing the waters with this CRAZY COOL and SUPER SECRET method of communication as I've probably already explained to you in person if not how did you get here without the script LOL. No offense my friend but you probably thought this was QR code or something with this GENIUS disguise. Plus, I trust that you knew how secretive the contents of this message might be that you wouldn't willy nilly go around showing it to anyone.

Cheerio!

P.S The button to activate world domination is actually hidden in your cupboard where you keep the wierd mustard shirt at the corner.
