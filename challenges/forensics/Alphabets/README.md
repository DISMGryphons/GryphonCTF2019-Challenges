## Hints
Ignore everything that is between 20-29 also read the numbers from the left to the right

## Solution:
Ignoring all the numbers between 20-29, 05 = E if u followed the table that was given in the txt file and 
notice how there isn't any 20s u should get 05 30 09 46 41 18 45(E d I t o R s) putting into the format
of GCTF{FLAG} u will get it.
