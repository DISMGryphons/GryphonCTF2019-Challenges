Not White

I was given an image that was suppose to be the message but i think i accidentally made it dissapear oops...

Please help me find the hidden message.

Hint:
Is the image truely only (255,255,255)?

Solution:

There's multiple ways to do this, you can either google for a code or a website that can inspect colors 
and make all the non (255,255,255) colors to any other color or use a code that is in Code.md
